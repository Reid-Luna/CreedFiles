    "description": "Michael's controversial imitation of a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (guest star Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge, aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff, and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an index card with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself. Nevertheless, when Pam falls asleep on Jim's shoulder at the end of the meeting, he concludes that it was \"not a bad day.\""

    "description": "In an effort to save money to prevent downsizing, Michael puts Dwight in charge of choosing the company's new health care plan.  Dwight's chosen plan slashes benefits, much to the chagrin of the other employees.  In an attempt to appease them, Michael promises the entire office a surprise, and then spends the rest of the day scrambling to come through with his promise. The employees wait for Michael's surprise, which he awkwardly never delivers. Meanwhile, Jim and Pam amuse themselves with Dwight's medical forms."

    "description": "As downsizing rumors swirl, paranoia takes over the members of the office. Dwight forms a \"Survivor\"-esque alliance with Jim against the other employeesâ€”later adding Pam also. Meanwhile, Michael arranges a morale-boosting birthday party for Supplier Relations representative Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery), although her birthday is more than a month away. Michael agonizes over writing the perfect greeting in her birthday card, and in the end, his joke (and subsequent rejected ones) falls flat, ruining the party."

    "description": "Michael and the office staff take on the workers in the warehouse in a basketball game. Through racist and sexist ideals, Michael chooses many of the lesser skilled office workers over their more athletic peers. Michael claims a \"flagrant personal intentional foul,\" stops the game, and declares his team as the winners. The warehouse finds the call unfair and Michael caves under pressure, and concedes the victory to the warehouse staff. Michael eventually tells the office that they don't have to come in on Saturday either, but it does little to calm them: \"Like coming in an extra day is going to prevent us from being downsized.\""
